# YouTube AI Event Detector: Colab

This colab uses [Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai) to detect if a certain event happens to videos from a defined channel and point out when exactly this event happens in the last X published videos.

Questions like:

* Someone wearing a black T-shirt
* A dog barking
* Drone footage
* A sunset

can be answered using this colab.
