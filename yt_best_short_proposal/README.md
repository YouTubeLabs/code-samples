# YouTube AI Short proposal: Colab

Let's have some fun with AI and YouTube!

By the end of this Colab, we will have created one or more YouTube Shorts
from a YouTube video using artificial intelligence (AI). For that, we
first get the best performing segments for the video in terms of audience
engagement using the YouTube Analytics API.
Then, for a segment chosen by the user, we will trim this short vertically
in 9:16 format on a moving focus point that will be the center of the
biggest object detected in the video [Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai).

Sounds great? Then wait no more and open the Colab here:
