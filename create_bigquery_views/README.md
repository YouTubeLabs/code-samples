# BigQuery View Creation Example

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/YouTubeLabs/code-samples/blob/main/create_bigquery_views/bigquery_view_creation_example.ipynb)

This Colab helps you combine BigQuery tables into a logical view that you can
query. The sample can be helpful when you want to combine the previous version
(v1.0) and a newer version (v1.0) of a report together, so that you can can
retain and easily query the whole history of the reports despite the change in
the schema.
