# YouTube Reporting API: Bulk Reporting Job Creation for Content Owners

The [YouTube Reporting API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/reporting/v1/reference/rest) enables developers to schedule reporting jobs and then download generated bulk reports. The API supports a predefined set of reports, each of which contains a comprehensive set of YouTube Analytics data for a channel or content owner.

This Colab notebook streamlines your YouTube Reporting API workflow by automating the creation of all available [reporting jobs](https://developers.google.com/youtube/reporting/v1/reference/rest) in bulk. This ensures you consistently collect comprehensive YouTube Analytics data for your content owner, without manually setting up each report.
