# YouTube AI Generated Live Stream: Colab

Let's have some fun with AI and YouTube!

By the end of this Colab, we will have created a YouTube live stream fully
generated via artificial intelligence (AI). For that, every X seconds, we get
the latest chat message posted by viewers on the live stream, we send that as a
prompt to [Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai) to generate an image
via AI, and we stream that image back to YouTube (with some cool animation :)).

Sounds great? Then wait no more and open the Colab here:
